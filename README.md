# Project Zomboid Server Docker

[![Build and Publish](https://github.com/tibuski/project-zomboid-server-docker/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tibuski/project-zomboid-server-docker/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/tibuski/project-zomboid-server-docker)](LICENSE)

A Docker container for the Project Zomboid dedicated server. Built from the ground up to be simple, reliable, and well-documented.

## Features

- **Automatic installation** -- Fetches and validates server files via DepotDownloader on first start
- **Graceful shutdown** -- `docker stop` triggers `save` then `quit` via RCON
- **Healthcheck** -- RCON-based health monitoring, Docker native `HEALTHCHECK`
- **Workshop mods** -- Auto-download mods from Steam Workshop on start
- **Automatic backups** -- Scheduled world backups with rotation
- **Auto-restart on updates** -- Detects Workshop mod and game build updates while running, warns players, and restarts to apply them (optional)
- **Discord webhook** -- Server start, stop, crash, update, and player join/leave notifications
- **Spawn regions** -- Restrict the character-creation spawn screen to the maps you choose via `SPAWN_REGIONS`
- **All config via env vars** -- No need to edit `.ini` files manually
- **Go entrypoint** -- Single binary, no shell scripts, proper error handling
- **Rootless** -- Runs as the `steam` user (UID 1000), never as root

## Quick Start

One-liner (GitHub Container Registry image):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pz-server \
  -p 16261:16261/udp -p 16262:16262/udp -p 27015:27015 \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-admin-password \
  -e RCON_PASSWORD=your-rcon-password \
  -v pz-data:/home/steam/Zomboid \
  ghcr.io/tibuski/project-zomboid-server-docker:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — ADMIN_PASSWORD and RCON_PASSWORD are optional:
# if left empty they are auto-generated and stored in ./data/credentials.env

mkdir -p data server-files backups
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 data server-files backups  # container runs as UID 1000

docker compose up -d
```

> The container runs as UID 1000 (`steam`). Create the host directories
> **before** `docker compose up` — if they don't exist, Docker creates them
> as root and the container cannot write to them.

The server will download (~5-10 minutes first time), then start. Once you see `LuaNet: Initialization [DONE]` in logs, players can join on port `16261`.

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

## Environment Variables

See [CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for the full reference. The most important ones:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SERVER_NAME` | `servertest` | Server/map name |
| `SPAWN_REGIONS` | (empty) | Semicolon-separated maps offered on the spawn screen (e.g. `Rosewood, KY`); empty keeps the server default |
| `PUBLIC_NAME` | `My PZ Server` | Public display name |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | auto-generated | Admin account password (stored in `data/credentials.env` when unset) |
| `RCON_PASSWORD` | auto-generated | RCON password (stored in `data/credentials.env` when unset) |
| `MAX_PLAYERS` | `16` | Player slots |
| `MAX_RAM` | `4096m` | JVM max heap |
| `MOD_WORKSHOP_IDS` | (empty) | Workshop mod IDs (semicolon-separated) |
| `MOD_WORKSHOP_COLLECTION_IDS` | (empty) | Steam collection IDs; items resolved automatically |
| `MOD_NAMES` | auto-detected | Mod folder names (empty = derived from downloads) |
| `UPDATE_ON_START` | `true` | Auto-download/verify server files on start |
| `SERVER_BRANCH` | (empty) | Beta branch (`unstable`, `legacy41`) |
| `STEAM_USER` / `STEAM_PASS` | (empty) | Optional Steam account (owns Project Zomboid) — only needed for private branches or workshop mods when anonymous downloads fail |
| `BACKUP_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable auto-backups |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | (empty) | Discord webhook URL |
| `SANDBOX_*` | (empty) | Any `SANDBOX_`-prefixed variable becomes a `SandboxVars.lua` key (gameplay tuning) |
| `INI_*` | (empty) | Any `INI_`-prefixed variable becomes a `server.ini` option, e.g. `INI_SleepAllowed=true` |

## Building

```bash
docker build -t project-zomboid-server .
```

### Podman

The image is Podman-compatible -- it builds and runs under Podman as well:

```bash
podman build --format docker -t project-zomboid-server .
```

One caveat: the Dockerfile uses a `HEALTHCHECK` and BuildKit cache mounts, both
of which Podman supports. With the default OCI output format Podman ignores the
`HEALTHCHECK`; pass `--format docker` to keep it active under Podman. The
pre-built image from the container registry behaves the same under Podman
except that the healthcheck is not surfaced -- this is cosmetic and does not
affect server operation.
