# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Discord `restart server` channel command: a new `discordbot` sidecar service (image published to GHCR alongside the server image; bot token + channel ID in `.env`) polls the channel and recreates the `zomboid` service on the latest image (`docker compose pull` + `up -d --force-recreate`). Exact case-insensitive match, bot authors and pre-start channel history are ignored, and a 5-minute cooldown (`RESTART_COOLDOWN`) blocks restart spam
- `SANDBOX_MODE` presets for performance: `apocalypse` (default), `performance` (world-cleanup: corpses 48h, blood 7d, rotten food 14d, rats off), `max` (adds reduced zombie population/rally groups for the best TPS)
- Nested sandbox overrides via dot notation: `SANDBOX_ZombieConfig.PopulationMultiplier=0.5` and `SANDBOX_ZombieLore.Speed=4` write into the nested b42 tables (env overrides still win over `SANDBOX_MODE`)
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` with JVM, sandbox, compose (cpuset/mem_limit/ulimits), storage and kernel tuning guidance
- Docker log rotation (`max-size: 10m`, `max-file: 3`) in both compose examples; `-trimpath` build flag and `VERSION` build arg for a smaller, reproducible entrypoint binary with a `--version` flag
- `SANDBOX_*` values are validated and rendered as safe Lua: control characters and invalid keys are rejected, strings are quoted automatically (also fixes unquoted values producing invalid Lua)
- Server config validation: `SERVER_NAME` restricted to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` (path traversal), `UDP_PORT` capped at 65534 (`SteamPort2 = UDP_PORT+1` overflow), `BACKUP_PATH` must resolve inside `DATA_DIR`
- RCON packet size capped at 64KB (malicious/corrupt peers can no longer force huge allocations)
- Docker HEALTHCHECK surfaces the underlying RCON error instead of a generic label
- Health server is gracefully shut down and no longer coupled to the server manager; `internal/health` now has test coverage
- Entrypoint orchestration extracted into a testable `run()` with error-path tests (`cmd/entrypoint`)
- CI: publish workflow now runs `go test`/`go vet`/gofmt and a Trivy filesystem scan before building; image builds attach SBOM/provenance and are scanned with Trivy; `dependabot.yml` and `SECURITY.md` added
- Compose: `stop_grace_period` raised to 120s (shutdown can exceed 60s), `init: true` (zombie reaping), multi-instance example uses profiles to stage servers

### Fixed
- Default sandbox values were Build 41 era: b42 renumbered several option scales (e.g. `Zombies = 1` became "Insane", `DayLength = 1` became 15 minutes) and loot options became direct multipliers, so servers created without `SANDBOX_*` overrides got extreme settings. Defaults now mirror the b42 "Apocalypse" preset (`server-files/media/lua/shared/Sandbox/Apocalypse.lua`)
- `MAX_RAM`/`MIN_RAM`/`GC_CONFIG`/`JVM_EXTRA_ARGS` were silently ignored: the game's `ProjectZomboid64.json` passes vmArgs on the java command line, overriding `_JAVA_OPTIONS`. The entrypoint now patches the json on every start so the env vars take effect (idempotent, preserves all other vmArgs)
- `SANDBOX_MODE` leaked into `SandboxVars.lua` as a stray `MODE` key
- Server `.ini` written with mode 0600 (the RCON password was world-readable in the data bind mount)
- `credentials.env` permissions re-tightened on every load; an unreadable credentials file now fails loudly instead of silently generating passwords that never persist
- Base images digest-pinned (`golang:1.23-alpine`, `cm2network/steamcmd:root`) for supply-chain integrity
- Removed the stale 9.8MB `entrypoint` binary from the repo root (gitignored build artifact)

### Changed
- Discord "Server Started" notification now fires when the server has actually finished booting: the entrypoint watches the server's stdout for the `RCON: listening on port` marker instead of announcing at JVM process launch
- Nested sandbox tables (flat `SANDBOX_ZombieConfig=...`) are only rendered through the mode/block builders; unsupported nested tables warn and are ignored
- `backup.Manager.Scheduler` no longer takes the server manager (decoupled; RCON save only needs the config)
- List parsing unified (`config.ParseList`) across config and steam packages

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- Initial release
- Go-based entrypoint with config generation (ini + lua)
- SteamCMD integration for server install/update
- Workshop mod auto-download
- Graceful shutdown via RCON save + quit
- RCON-based healthcheck
- Automatic world backups with rotation
- Discord webhook notifications (start, stop, crash)
- Multi-instance docker-compose example
- Complete documentation (README, Quickstart, Configuration, Mods, Backups, Discord, Admin Panel, Troubleshooting)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD (build, lint, push to GHCR + Docker Hub)

### Fixed
- SteamCMD no longer reports "Server files up to date" when the download silently failed: output is captured, `ERROR! Failed to install app`-style failures are detected, and the install is verified by checking `start-server.sh` afterwards
- Steam's intermittent anonymous-download failures (cryptic `Missing file permissions`/`Missing configuration` errors, rate-limiting of anonymous downloads) are now retried for ~6 minutes per start with a 60s backoff; docker's restart policy continues afterwards and partial downloads resume. Permanent failures (bad credentials) still fail immediately
- Workshop mod downloads get one automatic retry when the anonymous batch fails
- `STEAM_USER`/`STEAM_PASS`/`STEAM_GUARD_CODE` supported as the reliable workaround for the Steam-side failure and for workshop downloads when anonymous fails
- Refuses to run when `STEAM_USER` is set without `STEAM_PASS` (steamcmd would otherwise prompt and hang forever)
- Workshop collection resolution warning now points at `STEAM_API_KEY` when the Steam API rejects the keyless request
- Startup now fails fast with an actionable message when the mounted volumes are not writable by UID 1000 (previously a bare `credentials.env: permission denied`); docs cover creating/chowning the host directories before first start
- Crash at startup when `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is unset (nil-pointer in webhook notifications)
- Healthcheck failing when `RCON_PASSWORD`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` are auto-generated (passwords are now persisted to `<DATA_DIR>/credentials.env` and shared with the healthcheck)
- Final backup running before the world was saved on shutdown (server is stopped/saved first)
- Duplicate SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers racing during shutdown; `Stop()` now waits with a timeout and escalates to SIGKILL
- Shutdown only killing the bash wrapper instead of the whole process group (java child now terminated too)
- RCON commands waiting out the full read deadline (response is returned at the `RCON:` prompt line)
- Backup rotation exceeding `BACKUP_MAX_COUNT` (rotate now runs after creating the new backup)
- Backups triggered in the same second colliding (names now use nanosecond precision)

### Changed
- `MAX_RAM`, `MIN_RAM`, `GC_CONFIG`, `JVM_EXTRA_ARGS` are now applied to the server JVM via `_JAVA_OPTIONS` (previously ignored)
- `BIND_IP` is now written to the server `.ini` (previously ignored)
- Sandbox gameplay values are configurable via `SANDBOX_*` environment variables; `SandboxVars.lua` output is deterministic
- Auto-generated passwords are no longer printed to logs; they live in `<DATA_DIR>/credentials.env` (mode 0600)
- Scheduled backups issue an RCON `save` first so archives are consistent
- Docker healthcheck start period raised to 600s to cover the first-run SteamCMD install
- Removed non-functional `PUID`/`PGID`, `GAME_VERSION`, and `DISCORD_NOTIFY_PLAYERS` variables
- Health endpoint reports `installing` / `starting` / `healthy` / `stopping` status

### Mods
- Server files are now downloaded with DepotDownloader instead of SteamCMD's `app_update`. Steam's backend intermittently rejects anonymous `app_update` jobs (verified across games and IPs: license and appinfo are granted, but the download job is paused ~90% of the time); DepotDownloader's anonymous path downloads 380870 reliably
- Workshop mod downloads now capture steamcmd output and retry on detected failures (steamcmd exits 0 even when a workshop item fails)
- `MOD_NAMES` is now optional: mod folder names are auto-detected from downloaded workshop items and manual mods (folders containing `mod.info`)
- `MOD_WORKSHOP_COLLECTION_IDS` resolves Steam workshop collections to item IDs via the Steam Web API (keyless best-effort, `STEAM_API_KEY` supported)
- Workshop items download in a single steamcmd batch instead of one process per mod
- `MOD_UPDATE_ON_START` re-downloads all mods on every start to pick up updates
- Per-item download verification with a warning for private/region-locked/invalid items
- Manual mods: unzip mod folders into `<DATA_DIR>/Workshop/` and they are auto-detected
- `entrypoint mods` subcommand lists discovered mod folders and flags `MOD_NAMES` typos
- Mod list parsing accepts `;`, `,`, or whitespace separators and drops invalid IDs

### Tests
- Added unit tests: config parsing/validation, credential persistence, ini + sandbox generation, backup rotation/archive integrity, RCON protocol (fake server), process-group shutdown, webhook nil-safety
- CI now runs `go test ./...`
